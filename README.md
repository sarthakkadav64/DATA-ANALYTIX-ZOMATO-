# DATA-ANALYTIX-ZOMATO-
LEVEL 1	Suggestions
	
Task 1: Data Exploration and Preprocessing	
	
	
Handle missing values in each column	mean, median, mode - imputations
Analyze "Aggregate rating" distribution and identify class imbalances	Bin ratings like 1-2, 2.1-3, 3.1-4, 4.1-5 and plot charts to show distribution
Create rating distribution visualizations	
Compare cuisine/city average ratings	top 2 cuisine per city by rating
Analyze cuisine type vs rating relationship	
Identify most popular cuisines by vote count	
Find cuisines with consistently higher ratings	
	
Task 2: Descriptive Analysis	
	
Calculate basic statistical measures for numerical columns	mean mediam mode for all numerical columns
Explore distribution of categorical variables (Country Code, City, Cuisines)	charts for categorical column
Identify top cuisines and cities with highest restaurant counts	
	
Task 3: Geospatial Analysis	
	
Visualize restaurant locations using latitude/longitude	Use some 3rd party library like - shapely & geopandas
Analyze restaurant distribution across cities/countries	charts
Find correlations between location and ratings	
	
LEVEL 2	
	
Task 1: Table Booking and Online Delivery	
	
Calculate percentage of restaurants offering these services	
Compare ratings between restaurants with/without table booking	
Analyze online delivery availability across price ranges	
	
Task 2: Price Range Analysis	
	
Identify most common price range	
Calculate average rating per price range	
Find color representing highest average rating among price ranges	
	
Task 3: Feature Engineering	
	
Extract new features from existing columns	Split Cuisines into separate columns
Create binary features for table booking and online delivery	1,0
Encode categorical variables	Onehot
	
LEVEL 3	
	
Predictive Modeling	
	
Build regression model for restaurant rating prediction	
Split data into training/testing sets	
Compare performance of different algorithms (linear regression, decision trees, random forest)
